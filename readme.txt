API STARWARS (SWAPI) homework at the end of Web Module.
My personal goals with this project:
    a) practice Git procedures (feature branches, commit often, describe commits in a clean way),
    b) practice Flask and Jinja, HTML, CSS, JS
    c) practice MVC (Model-view-controller)
    d) learning and using new technology : REDIS, BOOTSTRAP, AJAX, JQUERY.
